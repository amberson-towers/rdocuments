## rdocuments

This repo contains an .RProj directory created and pushed from a local RStudio .RProj directory on Passmore's Mac Book Pro. The .Rmd files on the repo are [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files that simply are [Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-markdown/) files (familiar as .md) with some [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) code inserted in headers for document control. The .Rmd files are text files that you may edit in any text editor, if you are not an R and RStudio user.

[*bookdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/), an R package generated the layout and other document control for this document, which displays three individual documents that specify the governance of [Amberson Towers Condominium](https://www.ambersontowers.org/) on 5 Bayard Road in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania USA 15213.
