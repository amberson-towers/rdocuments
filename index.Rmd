## Three Documents Define Governance {-}

 The governing documents of Amberson Towers comprise three separate documents:

- **The Rules and Regulations** - General rules which can be amended by a majority vote of the Council.  Last amended in approximately September 2018.

 
- **The Declaration** - Mostly detailed information about the building, such as surveyor's coordinates and voting share of each unit.  Takes precedence over other documents. Requires agreement of 60% owners to amend.  First filed on March 14, 1978 and amended twice, most recently September 12, 1978, but only with very minor changes.

- **The Code of Regulations** - Regulates how the building is governed, for example how Council is elected.  Requires agreement of 60% ow owners to amend. First filed  April 12, 1978 and has been amended seven times (September 1978, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2016, and 2017).
